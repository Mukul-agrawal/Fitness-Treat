                    <p class="txt normal">If you don’t have enough to eat before you exercise, you may not have enough gas in the tank. You might burn fewer calories, too. Have some healthy carbs at least an hour in advance of your workout.
                        Try a bowl of whole-grain cereal with skim milk or some whole wheat toast or a bagel. Skip the cream cheese and butter. Saturated fats take longer to digest and can affect the amount of oxygen your blood delivers to your muscles.

                    <p class="txt normal">Don’t have much time before you head to the gym? Eat an apple or a banana 5 or 10 minutes before your workout for some quick, natural energy.
                        Your body easily digests these carbohydrates and turns them into the energy you need for exercise. Also, fruit is packed with helpful nutrients.</p>

                    <p class="txt normal">When you’re working out later in the day, have a small snack about an hour before you get started. A sports bar that has 200 calories or less is a good option.
                        Look for a bar with low-fiber content, ideally 3 grams or less. Too much fiber before a workout can upset your stomach.
                        On the ingredients list, keep an eye out for sugar alcohols, like sorbitol, xylitol, isomalt, and mannitol. Too much of these ingredients can give you cramps or diarrhea.</p>
