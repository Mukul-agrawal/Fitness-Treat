                <p class="txt normal">Jogging is a form of sustained running or trotting at a steady and slow pace. It is much slower than running but is faster than walking. The main purpose of jogging is to maintain your tempo without causing much strain to the body. This is less taxing on the body, consumes much lesser energy and thereby, helps to sustain for a longer time. Jogging is best suited for people who do not engage in rigorous fitness regimes. It is widely used by people to warm up and cool down the body during exercise routines or runs. People who prepare for runs and marathons take up jogging to build stamina and prep the body.</p>
